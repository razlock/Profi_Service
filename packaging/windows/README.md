# Offline Windows installer

`NikaCRM.iss` builds a single x64 installer that works without internet access.
It contains Python 3.12, PostgreSQL 18, NSSM, the sanitized demo database and
all Windows Python wheels required by the application.

SHA256 is written after the EXE is built (`WINDOWS_SETUP_SHA256` in `app/version.py`).

**Changelog 1.0.8 (2026-09-11):** installer finishes on a clean machine, in-app update check, progress on the last wizard page, demo catalog without owner data. See `docs/blog/43-windows-setup-1-0-8.md`.

## User installation

1. Download `NikaCRM-Offline-Setup-1.0.8-x64.exe` (links above).
2. Run it as an administrator and complete the short setup wizard.
3. Open **Nika CRM - Открыть** on the desktop.
4. Sign in with a demo account from `database/bootstrap/README.md` and change
   the password immediately if the computer is accessible to other people.
5. After changing SMTP in Settings, run **Nika CRM — Перезапуск службы**, then retest mail.

No separate Python or PostgreSQL installation is needed. The installer:

- installs the application under `%ProgramFiles%\NikaCRM`;
- keeps the database, environment and logs under `%ProgramData%\NikaCRM`;
- chooses PostgreSQL port `5432`, `55432` or `55433`, whichever is free;
- imports `nikacrm_public_sanitized.sql` and applies pending migrations;
- registers auto-start services `NikaCRM-PostgreSQL` and `NikaCRM-Web`;
- creates Open, Restart service and Logs shortcuts.

## Upgrade, uninstall and reinstall

Running a newer installer over an existing installation is an in-place upgrade:
both services are stopped before files are replaced, `%ProgramData%\NikaCRM`
(database, `.env`, logs) is reused and only pending migrations are applied.

Uninstall (**Nika CRM — Удалить** in the Start menu, or Apps & features) is a
full removal:

1. `pg_dump` of `nikacrm` plus a copy of `.env` into `%ProgramData%\NikaCRM-backup`
   (administrators only, last 10 dumps kept). This folder survives uninstall.
2. Services `NikaCRM-Web` and `NikaCRM-PostgreSQL` stopped and deleted, the
   bundled PostgreSQL uninstaller removes its registry entry and service account.
3. Firewall rule, shortcuts, `%ProgramFiles%\NikaCRM` and `%ProgramData%\NikaCRM`
   removed. If the dump fails, the data directory is kept and the user is told.

A later install finds the newest `nikacrm-*.sql` in `%ProgramData%\NikaCRM-backup`
and restores it instead of the demo database. Delete or move that folder to get a
clean demo install.

If the installation is broken and the uninstaller is unavailable, run as
administrator:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File packaging\windows\uninstall-full.ps1 -RemoveData
```

It stops and deletes both services, runs the PostgreSQL uninstaller, removes the
firewall rule, shortcuts, the Apps & features entry and `%ProgramFiles%\NikaCRM`;
`-RemoveData` also wipes `%ProgramData%\NikaCRM` after taking a dump. Without the
switch the database is kept.

## Build

Requirements for the build computer:

- Windows 10/11 x64;
- Python 3.12 available as `python`;
- Inno Setup 6 in its default installation directory;
- internet access only while creating/updating the offline bundle.

From an ordinary PowerShell window in the repository root:

```powershell
.\scripts\windows\build-offline-bundle.ps1
```

The script downloads version-pinned official installers, verifies SHA256,
resolves a CPython 3.12 Windows wheelhouse, writes an integrity manifest and
builds:

`packaging\windows\output\NikaCRM-Offline-Setup-1.0.7-x64.exe`

Downloaded assets and build output are deliberately excluded from Git. To
rebuild using already downloaded files:

```powershell
.\scripts\windows\build-offline-bundle.ps1 -SkipDownload
```

Verify only:

```powershell
.\scripts\windows\verify-bundle.ps1
```

Run the installer in a clean Windows Sandbox and collect JSON/log results:

```powershell
.\scripts\windows\Start-WindowsSandboxSmoke.ps1
```

## Diagnostics

- Setup log: `%ProgramData%\NikaCRM\logs\setup.log`
- Web stdout: `%ProgramData%\NikaCRM\logs\web-stdout.log`
- Web stderr: `%ProgramData%\NikaCRM\logs\web-stderr.log`
- Inno Setup log: pass `/LOG="C:\path\setup.log"` to the installer
- Service status: `Get-Service NikaCRM-Web,NikaCRM-PostgreSQL`

### Port is occupied

The database installer automatically tries `5432`, `55432` and `55433`.
The web service listens on all interfaces (`APP_HOST=0.0.0.0`, port `5000`) so
other PCs on the LAN can open `http://<this-pc-ip>:5000`. Locally you can still
use `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. Stop any other program using port `5000` before
installation:

```powershell
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 5000 | Select-Object OwningProcess
```

### Access from the local network (LAN)

New installs are LAN-ready by default:

- `APP_HOST=0.0.0.0`
- `TRUSTED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1,@private,<COMPUTERNAME>,...`
- Windows Firewall inbound rule **Nika CRM (HTTP 5000)** for **Any** profile (recreated on setup/repair so older Private/Domain-only rules are upgraded; Sandbox-safe)
- `TRUSTED_HOSTS` includes `@private` so any LAN IP works without editing `.env` (app Host check + dynamic Socket.IO CORS, not a per-IP list)

If an older install still opens only on this PC, run (as Administrator):

```powershell
powershell -NoLogo -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:ProgramFiles\NikaCRM\app\packaging\windows\enable-lan-access.ps1"
```

Or use the Start menu shortcut **Nika CRM — Доступ по сети (LAN)**.

**Security:** any device on the same private network can reach the CRM. Change
demo passwords (`admin` / `111111`, …) immediately.

### PostgreSQL password (pgAdmin)

There is **no fixed database password** such as `111111`. That password is only
for demo **web** accounts. PostgreSQL passwords are random per installation.

Show them (Administrator PowerShell):

```powershell
powershell -NoLogo -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:ProgramFiles\NikaCRM\app\packaging\windows\show-db-credentials.ps1"
```

Or Start menu: **Nika CRM — Пароль базы данных**.

Credentials are stored in:

- `%ProgramData%\NikaCRM\installer\install-state.json` (`postgres_super_password`, `app_db_password`, `postgres_port`) — ACL: SYSTEM + Administrators only
- `%ProgramData%\NikaCRM\.env` → `DATABASE_URL` (role `nikacrm`)

Connect in pgAdmin to `127.0.0.1`, database `nikacrm`, user `nikacrm` (or
`postgres` for the superuser), port from the script (usually `5432`).

### PostgreSQL does not start

Check `Get-Service NikaCRM-PostgreSQL`, the setup log, and PostgreSQL logs in
`%ProgramData%\NikaCRM\PostgreSQL\data\log`. Do not delete the data directory
before making a backup.

### Web service does not start

Check both web logs and restart:

```powershell
Restart-Service NikaCRM-Web
Invoke-WebRequest http://127.0.0.1:5000/login -UseBasicParsing
```

### Windows warns about an unknown publisher

Local development builds are not Authenticode-signed. Public releases should
be signed with the project's code-signing certificate before distribution.
